2. FUEL SHUTOFF Valve - ON (push full in)
3. FUEL SELECTOR Valve - BOTH
4. FUEL PUMP Switch - ON
5. Mixture Control - RICH (if restart has not occurred)
6. MAGNETOS Switch - BOTH (or START if propeller is stopped)
7. FUEL PUMP Switch - OFF
NOTE
If the propeller is windmilling, engine will restart automatically within a few seconds. If propeller has
stopped (possible at low speeds), turn MAGNETOS switch to START, advance throttle slowly from idle
and lean the mixture from full rich as required to obtain smooth operation.
NOTE
If the indicated fuel flow (FFLOW GPH) immediately drops to zero, a sign of failure of the engine-driven
fuel pump, return the FUEL PUMP switch to the ON position.
---
6
IDLE POWER ENGINE ROUGHNESS

An excessively rich idle fuel flow may cause low speed engine roughness during flight. During most in-flight low engine
speeds (power off stalls, approach to landing, etc.), the mixture control is normally in the full-rich position. However,
to improve engine roughness (caused by an improperly adjusted fuel servo) during low engine speeds while in flight,
you should rotate the vernier mixture control (leaning of fuel mixture). You may also have to lean the fuel mixture if this
low engine speed results in power loss and you need to restart the engine during flight. In all cases, you should land
the airplane at the nearest airport for repairs if low speed engine roughness requires you to adjust the fuel mixture
control to improve engine operation.
---
7
ENGINE-DRIVEN FUEL PUMP FAILURE

Failure of the engine-driven fuel pump will be shown by a sudden reduction in the fuel flow indication (FFLOW GPH)

immediately before a loss of power while operating from a fuel tank containing adequate fuel. If the engine-driv-
en fuel pump fails, immediately set the FUEL PUMP switch to the ON position to restore the engine power. The flight

should be terminated as soon as practical and the engine-driven fuel pump repaired.

(If fire is not extinguished, increase glide speed to find an airspeed, within airspeed limitations, which will provide
an incombustible mixture)
8. Forced Landing - EXECUTE (refer to EMERGENCY LANDING WITHOUT ENGINE POWER)
---
9
SPARK PLUG FOULING

A slight engine roughness in flight may be caused by one or more spark plugs becoming fouled by carbon or lead
deposits. This may be verified by turning the MAGNETOS switch momentarily from BOTH to either L or R position.
An obvious power loss in single magneto operation is evidence of spark plug or magneto trouble. Since spark plugs
are the more likely cause, lean the mixture to the recommended lean setting for cruising flight. If the problem does
not clear up in several minutes, determine if a richer mixture setting will produce smoother operation. If not, proceed
to the nearest airport for repairs using the BOTH position of the MAGNETOS switch unless extreme roughness
makes the use of a single MAGNETO position necessary.
---
10
LOW OIL PRESSURE

If the low oil pressure annunciator (OIL PRESS) comes on, check the oil pressure indicator (OIL PRES on ENGINE
page or OIL PSI on SYSTEM page) to confirm low oil pressure condition. If oil pressure and oil temperature (OIL
TEMP on ENGINE page or OIL °F on SYSTEM page) remain normal, it is possible that the oil pressure sending unit
or relief valve is malfunctioning. Land at the nearest airport to determine the source of the problem.
If a total loss of oil pressure and a rise in oil temperature occur at about the same time, it could mean that the engine
is about to fail. Reduce power immediately and select a field suitable for a forced landing. Use only the minimum
power necessary to reach the landing site.

MAGNETO MALFUNCTION

Sudden engine roughness or misfiring is usually a sign of a magneto problem. Changing the MAGNETOS switch
from BOTH to the L and R switch positions will identify which magneto is malfunctioning. Select different power
settings and enrichen the mixture to determine if continued operation on BOTH magnetos is possible. If not, change
to the good magneto and continue to the nearest airport for repairs.
RECOMMENDED STARTER DUTY CYCLE
Operate the starter motor for 10 seconds followed by a 20 second cool down period. This cycle can be repeated

two additional times, followed by a ten minute cool down period before resuming cranking. After cool down, op-
erate the starter motor again, three cycles of 10 seconds followed by 20 seconds of cool down. If the engine still

does not start, try to find the cause.

4. Directional Control - MAINTAIN (using brake on good wheel as required)
LANDING WITHOUT ELEVATOR CONTROL

Trim for horizontal flight with an airspeed of approximately 65 KIAS and flaps set to 20° by using throttle and el-
evator trim controls. Then do not change the elevator trim control setting; control the glide angle by adjusting

power. During the landing flare (round-out), the nose will come down when power is reduced and the airplane
may touch down on the nose wheel before the main wheels. When in the flare, the elevator trim control should be
adjusted toward the full nose up position and the power adjusted at the same time so that the airplane will rotate
to a horizontal attitude for touchdown. Close the throttle at touchdown.

26
SPINS

Should an inadvertent spin occur, the following recovery procedure should be used:
1. RETARD THROTTLE TO IDLE POSITION.
2. PLACE AILERONS IN NEUTRAL POSITION.
3. APPLY AND HOLD FULL RUDDER OPPOSITE TO THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION.
4. JUST AFTER THE RUDDER REACHES THE STOP, MOVE THE CONTROL WHEEL BRISKLY FORWARD FAR
ENOUGH TO BREAK THE STALL. Full down elevator may be required at aft center of gravity loadings to assure
optimum recoveries.
5. HOLD THESE CONTROL INPUTS UNTIL ROTATION STOPS. Premature relaxation of the control inputs may
extend the recovery.
6. AS ROTATION STOPS, NEUTRALIZE RUDDER, AND MAKE A SMOOTH RECOVERY FROM THE RESULTING
DIVE.
NOTE
If the rate of the spin makes determining the direction of rotation difficult, the magenta turn rate indicator
at the top of the HSI compass card will show the rate and direction of the turn. The HSI compass card
will rotate in the opposite direction. Hold opposite rudder to the turn vector direction.
For additional information on spins and spin recovery, see the discussion under SPINS in Normal Procedures,
Section 4.

3. CABIN HT Control Knob - ON (pull full out)
4. Defroster Control Outlets - OPEN (to obtain maximum windshield defroster airflow)
5. CABIN AIR Control Knob - ADJUST (to obtain maximum defroster heat and airflow)
6. Watch for signs of induction air filter icing. A loss of engine RPM could be caused by ice blocking the air
intake filter. Adjust the throttle as necessary to hold engine RPM. Adjust mixture as necessary for any change in
power settings.
7. Plan a landing at the nearest airport. With an extremely rapid ice build-up, select a suitable off airport landing
site.
8. With an ice accumulation of 0.25 inch or more on the wing leading edges, be prepared for significantly
higher power requirements, higher approach and stall speeds, and a longer landing roll.
9. Leave wing flaps retracted. With a severe ice build-up on the horizontal tail, the change in wing wake airflow
direction caused by wing flap extension could result in a loss of elevator effectiveness.
10. Open left window and, if practical, scrape ice from a portion of the windshield for visibility in the landing
approach.
11. Perform a landing approach using a forward slip, if necessary, for improved visibility.
12. Approach at 65 to 75 KIAS depending upon the amount of ice accumulation.
13. Perform landing in level attitude.
14. Missed approaches should be avoided whenever possible because of severely reduced climb capability.

29
ENTRANCE DOORS AND CABIN WINDOWS (CHAPTER 7)

Entry to and exit from the airplane is accomplished through either of two entry doors, one on each side of the cabin,
at the front seat positions, Refer to Section 6 for cabin and cabin door dimensions. The doors incorporate a recessed
exterior door handle, a conventional interior door handle, a key operated door lock, left door only, a door stop
mechanism, and openable windows in both the left and right doors.
NOTE
The door latch design on this model requires that the outside door handle on the pilot and front passenger
doors be extended out whenever the doors are open. When closing the door, do not attempt to push the
door handle in until the door is fully shut.
To open the doors from outside the airplane, utilize the recessed door handle near the aft edge of either door by
grasping the forward edge of the handle and pulling outboard. To close or open the doors from inside the airplane,
use the combination door handle and arm rest. The inside door handle has three positions and a placard at its base
which reads OPEN, CLOSE, and LOCK. The handle is spring loaded to the CLOSE (up) position. When the door
has been pulled shut and latched, lock it by rotating the door handle forward to the LOCK position (flush with the
arm rest). When the handle is rotated to the LOCK position, an over center action will hold it in that position. Both
cabin doors should be locked prior to flight, and should not be opened intentionally during flight.
NOTE
Accidental opening of a cabin door in flight, due to improper closing, does not constitute a need to land
the airplane. The best procedure is to set up the airplane in a trimmed condition at approximately 75 KIAS,
momentarily shove the door outward slightly, and forcefully close and lock the door.
Exit from the airplane is accomplished by rotating the door handle from the LOCK position, past the CLOSE position,
aft to the OPEN position and pushing the door open. To lock the airplane, lock the right cabin door with the inside
handle, close the left cabin door, and using the ignition key, lock the door.
The left and right cabin doors are equipped with openable windows which are held in the closed position by a
detent equipped latch on the lower edge of the window frame. To open the windows, rotate the latch upward. Each
window is equipped with a spring-loaded retaining arm which will help rotate the window outward, and hold it
there. If required, either window may be opened at any speed up to 163 KIAS. The rear side windows and rear
windows are of the fixed type and cannot be opened.

BALKED LANDING

1. Throttle Control - FULL (push full in)
2. Wing Flaps - RETRACT to 20°
3. Climb Speed - 60 KIAS
4. Wing Flaps - 10° (as obstacle is cleared), then UP (after reaching a safe altitude and 65 KIAS)
CHAPTER 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES
In a balked landing (go-around) climb, reduce the flap setting to 20° immediately after full
power is applied and climb at 60 KIAS. If obstacles must be cleared during the go-around
climb, reduce the wing flap setting to 10° and maintain a safe airspeed until the obstacles
are cleared. Above 3000 feet pressure altitude, lean the mixture to obtain maximum RPM.
After clearing any obstacles, carefully retract the flaps and allow the airplane to accelerate
to normal climb airspeed.
---

WINDSHIELD DAMAGE

If a bird strike or other incident should damage the windshield in flight to the point of creating an opening, a sig-
nificant loss in performance may be expected. This loss may be minimized in some cases (depending on amount of

damage, altitude, etc.) by opening the side windows while the airplane is maneuvered for a landing at the nearest
airport. If airplane performance or other adverse conditions prevent landing at an airport, prepare for an off airport
landing in accordance with the Precautionary Landing With Engine Power or Ditching checklists.
